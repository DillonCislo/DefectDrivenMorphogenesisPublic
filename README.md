# DefectDrivenMorphogenesisPublic
A clean repository of code used for "Active Cell Divisions Generate Fourfold Orientationally Ordered Phase in Living Tissue" by Cislo, Yang, Qin, Pavlopoulos, Bowick &amp; Streichan (2023)

All code was tested in MATLAB 2021b. No additional code/third party repositories should be necessary to run the scripts. If you want to generate the figures without running the data generating scripts yourself (this can take quite a while), all simulated results are available on Dryad (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.c2fqz61d4). Instructions for using that data to generate the figures are contained in the Dryad README files. Some fiddling of directory names might be necessary, but should be obvious from documentation in the relevent scripts.
